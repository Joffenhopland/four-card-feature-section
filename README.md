### Links

### My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

To make the layout of the box section I used flexbox. But to stack the two boxes in the center I had to place them inside of a div. Then I used align-items: center; to center the boxes on the sides.

### Continued development

Keep getting more comfortable with flexbox.
